## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-lesson-plan-generator.git
cd ai-lesson-plan-generator

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

### Generating a Lesson Plan

Run the main script to generate a lesson plan by specifying the topic, class duration (in minutes), and desired learning outcome:

```bash
python generate_lesson_plan.py --topic "Introduction to Quantum Physics" --duration 45 --outcome "Understand the basics of quantum mechanics"
```

## Adding Context with PDF Uploads

### Enhance your lesson plan with additional context by uploading relevant PDF files:

```bash
python generate_lesson_plan.py --topic "History of Art" --duration 60 --outcome "Explore major art movements" --upload pdfs/art_history.pdf
```

## Exporting Your Lesson Plan

### Choose your preferred export format. The lesson plan can be saved as JSON for integration or as a PDF for presentation:

```bash
# Export as JSON
python generate_lesson_plan.py --topic "Computer Science" --duration 50 --export json

# Export as PDF
python generate_lesson_plan.py --topic "Biology" --duration 50 --export pdf
```

## Architecture & Workflow

 - Input Stage: The educator provides the topic, duration, desired outcome, and optional PDFs.
 - Processing Stage: The system parses the inputs, reads additional PDF context, and prepares parameters for the LLM.
 - Content Generation: The LLM generates a structured lesson plan tailored to the provided inputs.
 - Output Stage: The generated lesson plan is formatted and exported as JSON or PDF.
 - Feedback Loop: Future versions will integrate feedback to refine and personalize the generated content further.
